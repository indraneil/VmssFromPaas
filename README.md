## Things to consider when you are moving from Azure cloud services to Azure virtual machine scale sets
This set of articles is for people who understand [Azure cloud services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me) and are curious about Azure virtual machine scale sets or [vmss](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview).

There are a lot of new concepts to learn, and the chapters guide you through those.
Start at the <a href="Introduction.md">Introduction</a> and then either follow along or browse whichever chapter that catches you eye.

## What to do if you notice something that is incorrect
VMSS is constantly being improved (azure cloud services are stable). So if you notice information that is out of date, please create a pull request and send it my way and I will do my best to reconcile the differences.
